[descheduler](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/descheduler) is a Kubernetes add-on that helps optimize resource utilization and clean up unused resources in your cluster. It works by identifying and rescheduling pods that are running on underutilized nodes to more suitable nodes, freeing up resources for other pods to use. This helps to improve the overall performance of your cluster and reduce waste.
