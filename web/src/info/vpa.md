[Kubernetes Vertical Pod Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler) (VPA) is a Kubernetes feature that enables automatic scaling of resources for individual pods in a cluster. It works by analyzing resource usage data for pods and adjusting their resource requests and limits to optimize resource utilization. This helps to ensure that your applications have the resources they need to run effectively, while also reducing waste and improving overall cluster efficiency.
