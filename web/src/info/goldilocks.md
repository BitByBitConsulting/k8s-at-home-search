[Golidlocks](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/goldilocks) is an open-source project that provides a set of tools and resources for optimizing resource requests and limits in Kubernetes. It works by analyzing resource usage data for your pods and comparing it against the defined resource requests and limits. This allows you to identify resources that are over-allocated or under-allocated, and make adjustments to optimize resource utilization. With Goldilocks, you can improve the performance and efficiency of your home lab, reduce waste, and ensure that your applications have the resources they need to run effectively.
