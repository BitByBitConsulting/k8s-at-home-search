[cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) is a certificate management controller for Kubernetes. It automates the management and issuance of TLS certificates from various issuing sources. It will ensure certificates are valid and up to date periodically, and attempt to renew certificates at an appropriate time before expiry.
