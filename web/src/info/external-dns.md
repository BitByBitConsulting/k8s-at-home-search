[ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) is a Kubernetes add-on that automatically manages the creation and updates of DNS records for services running in your cluster. It integrates with a variety of DNS providers, such as CloudFlare DNS, Amazon Route 53, Google Cloud DNS, and more, to ensure that your applications are easily accessible from anywhere with a DNS name. With ExternalDNS, you can simplify the process of managing DNS records for your home lab, eliminating the need for manual updates and reducing the risk of errors.
